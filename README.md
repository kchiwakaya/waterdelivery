## H2O ‚Äì Fleet & Water Delivery (Android)

A mobile app for managing water delivery operations. Dispatchers, drivers, and fleet owners can register trucks, select a truck to operate, and sync essential data in real time. Built with Jetpack Compose and Firebase to provide a modern, responsive UI and reliable cloud-backed storage.

### Why it matters

- **Operational clarity**: Assign and switch trucks quickly to reduce dispatch friction.
- **Real‚Äëtime data**: Cloud sync via Firebase keeps truck info up to date across devices.
- **Modern Android UX**: Compose + Material 3 delivers a fast and accessible experience.

## üîê Security Posture

- **Backups disabled**: `android:allowBackup="false"` to prevent unauthorized ADB backups.
- **No cleartext traffic**: `android:usesCleartextTraffic="false"` in manifest.
- **Release hardening**: Code shrinking/obfuscation and resource shrinking enabled for `release`.
- **Least exposure**: Only the launcher activity is exported; others are `exported=false`.
- **Secrets hygiene**: No hardcoded API keys or secrets detected; `google-services.json` is git-ignored.

If you introduce WebView or network clients, ensure TLS is enforced and avoid `addJavascriptInterface` unless strictly necessary and sandboxed.
